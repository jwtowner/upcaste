Change cstdio.hpp to use our portable version of printf/scanf when in use with MSVC.
Fix the formatting of floats in printf/fast_printf variants.
Implement scanf/fast_scanf variants.
Setup configuration and build system on *nix using autoconf and tundra.
Double check configuration macros and detection of platform functions on *nix.
Implement memset_pattern16 and memset_pattern16 and update uninitialized_fill_n.
Add implementations for wide-character versions of printf/scanf functions.
Add support for the C floating-point environment and implment cfenv.hpp.
Optimize and test the s-expression parser/lexer more thoroughly.
Implement memccpy, stpcpy, stpncpy, and better implement mempcpy.
Implement wmemccpy, wcpcpy, wcpncpy, and better implement wmempcpy.
Implement the C11 threads layer for POSIX platforms.
Implement c16rtomb, c32rtomb, mbrtoc16, and mbrtoc32 functions in cuchar.hpp.
Implement filesystem copy and copy_directory functions.
Implement filesystem for POSIX platforms.
Consider implementing custom version of atomics library that is more optimized for MSVC and GCC.
Test filesystem more thoroughly on Windows.
Finish implementing transcedental functions for vector math library.
Revamp the generic C++ port of the vector math library, and get it working again.
Add ARM NEON port of the vector math library.
Implement concurrent_linear_region/concurrent_linear_allocator in region.hpp.
Add denseset container data type and functions, counterpart to the densemap type.
Add a denseindex data type, which is like densemap but uses unique integer keys--values might be integer offsets into an array.
Add perfect hashing library which can auto-generate an optimized C++ hashing function source file for a given key set.
Add Clang/LLVM compiler support.
Improve the benchmarking code in uptest to output more useful metrics, and get rid of the useless ones like the iteration/size count--maybe make it customizable via a format string or flags.
Add a simplified random number library to upcore... no need to go overboard, just fast basic integer and floating point normal distributions.
Add a command line arguments parsing library to upcore.
Make sure function attributes in cuchar.hpp match the ones in cstring.hpp.
